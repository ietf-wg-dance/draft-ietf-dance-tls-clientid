    <abstract>
      <t>
	This document specifies a TLS extension to convey a DNS-Based
	Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Client Identity to a 
	TLS server. This is useful for applications that perform TLS
	client certificate verification via DANE TLSA records.
      </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	This document specifies a <xref target="RFC6066">
	Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension</xref> to convey a 
	<xref target="RFC6698">DANE</xref>
	Client Identity to the TLS server. This is useful for 
	applications that perform TLS client certificate verification 
	via DANE TLSA records, as described in 
	<xref target="DANECLIENT">"DANE client certificates"</xref>.
	The conveyed identity is in the form of a domain name associated 
	with the client that is expected to have a corresponding DANE TLSA 
	record published in the DNS.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Authentication Model">
      <t>
	When TLS clients use X.509 client certificates or raw public
	keys that are authenticated via DANE TLSA records, they need a 
	mechanism to convey their DANE identity to the server. The TLS 
	extension defined in this document is used to accomplish this. 
	Upon receipt of this extension, a TLS server learns the 
	client's identity and the fact that the client expects that 
	the server can authenticate it via a corresponding DNSSEC-
	validated TLSA record. In the case of X.509 client certificates, 
	a TLS server can learn the client's identity by examining subject
	alternative names included in the certificate itself. However,
	without a mechanism such as the one defined in this extension,
	the TLS server cannot know apriori that the client has a 
	published TLSA record, and thus may unnecessarily issue DNS 
	queries for DANE TLSA records in-band with the TLS handshake 
	even in cases where the client has no TLSA record associated 
	with it. When <xref target="RFC7250">TLS raw public 
	keys</xref> are being used to authenticate the client, the
	client uses this extension to explicitly indicate to the 
	server what its domain name identity is. Detailed protocol
	behavior of TLS clients and servers is described in the
	<xref target="DANECLIENT">DANE client certificates
	draft</xref>.

      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="DANE Client Identity Extension">
      <t>
	The "extension_data" field of the DANE Client Identity
	extension MUST contain a client name specified in the 
	following format. [Question: should multiple client names
	be supported?]
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[

enum {
    dns_name(0), srv_name(1), (255)
} NameType;

opaque dNSName<1..2^16-1>;
opaque SRVName<1..2^16-1>;

struct {
    NameType name_type;
    select (name_type) {
        case dns_name: dNSName;
        case srv_name: SRVName;
    } name;
} DaneClientName;
        ]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
	The opaque dNSName or SRVName field contains the domain name
	of the client in textual presentation format, as described in
	<xref target="RFC1035">RFC 1035</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
	[For discussion: Is the dNSName/SRVName distinction useful, 
	or can we just simplify and use only dNSName? These two name
	forms are analogous to the two recommended for use in X.509
	certificates in the DANE client certificates draft, so the
	server could use this to additionally check against the 
	corresponding certificate fields (but does it need to?).
	If the server needs a hint of whether to construct an
	application specific ID, then this might be useful, but this
	could also be inferred from the structure of the name and
	the client could just specify an application specific identity 
	in the dNSName type.]

	in [RFC7120]
