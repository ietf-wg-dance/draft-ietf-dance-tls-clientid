	This document specifies a TLS and DTLS extension to convey a
	DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Client Identity
	to a TLS or DTLS server. This is useful for applications that
	perform TLS client authentication via DANE TLSA records.

	This document specifies a <xref target="RFC6066" format="default">
	Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension</xref> to convey a
	<xref target="RFC6698" format="default">DANE</xref>
	Client Identity to the TLS server. This is useful for
	applications that perform TLS client authentication
	via DANE TLSA records, as described in
	<xref target="DANECLIENT" format="default"/>. The extension could be
        empty to indicate to the server that the client has a DANE record and
        that the server can perform DANE authentication of the client with
        the identity extracted from the client certificate. Or the extension
        can contain the full client identity, in the form of the DNS domain
        name that is expected to have a DANE TLSA record published for it.
      </t>
      <t>
	This extension supports both TLS <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/>
        <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC6347" format="default">DTLS
        </xref>, and the term TLS in this document is used generically
	to describe both protocols.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Overview" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Overview</name>
      <t>
	When TLS clients use X.509 client certificates or raw public
	keys that are authenticated via DANE TLSA records, it is useful
        for them to convey their intent to be authenticated via DANE, or
        even to convey their complete DANE identity to the server. The TLS
	extension defined in this document is used to accomplish this.
      </t>
      <t>
	In the case of X.509 client certificates, a TLS server can
	learn the client's identity by examining subject alternative
	names included in the certificate itself. However, without a
	mechanism such as the one defined in this extension, the TLS
	server cannot know apriori that the client has a published
	TLSA record, and thus may unnecessarily issue DNS queries for
	DANE TLSA records in-band with the TLS handshake even in cases
	where the client has no TLSA record associated with it. When
	multiple identities are present in the certificate, a client
	must use this extension to specify exactly which one the server
	should use. An additional situation in which this extension
	helps is where some TLS servers may need to selectively prompt
	for client certificate credentials only for clients that are
	equipped to provide certificates.
      </t>
      <t>
	When <xref target="RFC7250" format="default">TLS raw public
	keys</xref> are being used to authenticate the client, the
	client uses this extension to explicitly indicate to the
	server what its domain name identity is (since there is no
        X.509 certificate from which the identity can be extracted).
      </t>
      <t>
	Detailed protocol behavior of TLS clients and servers is
	described in <xref target="DANECLIENT" format="default"/>.
      </t>

      <name>DANE Client Identity Extension</name>
      <t>
	The DANE Client Identity Extension type, "dane_clientid",
	will have a value assigned and registered in the IANA
	TLS Extensions registry. Its extension data (if not
        empty) has the following format:
      </t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[

opaque ClientName<1..2^8-1>;
        ]]></artwork>
      <t>
	The ClientName field contains the single domain name of
	the client in textual presentation format, as described in
	<xref target="RFC1035" format="default">RFC 1035</xref>,
        omitting the trailing dot.
      </t>
      <t>
	A TLS server implementing this specification MAY send
	an empty extension of type "dane_clientid" to indicate that
        it understands the extension and is capable of performing
        DANE client authentication. In TLS 1.2, the empty extension
        is sent in the ServerHello message. In TLS 1.3, it is sent
        in the CertificateRequest message.
      </t>
      <t>
	A TLS client implementing this specification SHOULD send
	an extension of type "dane_clientid". If the client only needs
        to indicate that it has a DANE record and that the client's
        domain name identity can be obtained from its certificate, then
        the extension sent can be empty. If the client needs to send
        its domain name identity, then the "extension_data" field
        of the extension MUST contain a "ClientName" data structure
        populated with the domain name.
      </t>
      <t>
        In TLS 1.2, the client extension is sent in the ClientHello message.
        In TLS 1.3, it is sent in the Certificate message.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        In TLS 1.3, this extension is sent in the CertificateRequest
        and Certificate messages, which are encrypted.
      </t>
      <t>
        In TLS 1.2, this extension cannot be encrypted. When used
        with TLS 1.2, to prevent unnecessary privacy leakage of the
        client's name in cleartext, a TLS client implementing this
        specification should be configured to only send this extension
        to TLS servers it intends to perform client authentication with.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>

	This extension requires the registration of a new value in the
	TLS ExtensionsType registry.
