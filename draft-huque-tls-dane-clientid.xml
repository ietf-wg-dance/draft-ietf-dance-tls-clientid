    <abstract>

	This document specifies a TLS and DTLS extension to convey a
	DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Client Identity
	to a TLS or DTLS server. This is useful for applications that
	perform TLS client authentication via DANE TLSA records.

	This document specifies a <xref target="RFC6066" format="default">
	Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension</xref> to convey a
	<xref target="RFC6698" format="default">DANE</xref>
	Client Identity to the TLS server. This is useful for
	applications that perform TLS client authentication
	via DANE TLSA records, as described in
	<xref target="DANECLIENT" format="default"/>. The extension could be
        empty to indicate to the server that the client has a DANE record and
        that the server can perform DANE authentication of the client with
        the identity extracted from the client certificate. Or the extension
        can contain the full client identity, in the form of the DNS domain
        name that is expected to have a DANE TLSA record published for it.
      </t>
      <t>
	This extension supports both TLS <xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/>
        <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC6347" format="default">DTLS
        </xref>, and the term TLS in this document is used generically
	to describe both protocols.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Overview" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Overview</name>
      <t>
	When TLS clients use X.509 client certificates or raw public
	keys that are authenticated via DANE TLSA records, it is useful
        for them to convey their intent to be authenticated via DANE, or
        even to convey their complete DANE identity to the server. The TLS
	extension defined in this document is used to accomplish this.
      </t>
      <t>
	In the case of X.509 client certificates, a TLS server can
	learn the client's identity by examining subject alternative
	names included in the certificate itself. However, without a
	mechanism such as the one defined in this extension, the TLS
	server cannot know apriori that the client has a published
	TLSA record, and thus may unnecessarily issue DNS queries for
	DANE TLSA records in-band with the TLS handshake even in cases
	where the client has no TLSA record associated with it. When
	multiple identities are present in the certificate, a client
	can use this extension to specify exactly which one the server
	should use. An additional situation in which this extension
	helps is where some TLS servers may need to selectively prompt
	for client certificate credentials only for clients that are
	equipped to provide certificates.
      </t>
      <t>
	When <xref target="RFC7250" format="default">TLS raw public
	keys</xref> are being used to authenticate the client, the
	client uses this extension to explicitly indicate to the
	server what its domain name identity is (since there is no
        X.509 certificate from which the identity can be extracted).
      </t>
      <t>
	Detailed protocol behavior of TLS clients and servers is
	described in <xref target="DANECLIENT" format="default"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>DANE Client Identity Extension</name>
      <t>
	The DANE Client Identity Extension type, "dane_clientid",
	will have a value assigned and registered in the IANA
	TLS Extensions registry. Its format is similar to the TLS
        Server Name Indication extension.
      </t>
      <t>
	A TLS client implementing this specification SHOULD send
	an extension of type "dane_clientid" in the ClientHello
	handshake message to TLS servers it intends to perform DANE
	client authentication with.
      </t>
      <t>If the client only needs to indicate that it has a DANE
         record and that the client's domain name identity can be
         obtained from its certificate, then the extension sent can
         be empty.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the client additionally needs to send its domain name
        identity, then the "extension_data" field of the extension
        MUST contain a "ClientNameList" data structure defined in the
        following format:
      </t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[

struct {
    NameType name_type;
    select (name_type) {
        case host_name: HostName;
    } name;
} ClientName;

enum {
    host_name(0), (255)
} NameType;

opaque HostName<1..2^16-1>;

struct {
    ClientName client_name_list<1..2^16-1>
} ClientNameList;

        ]]></artwork>
      <t>
	The opaque HostName field contains the domain name
	of the client in textual presentation format, as described in
	<xref target="RFC1035" format="default">RFC 1035</xref>. The
        ClientNameList MUST NOT contain more than one name of the same
        name_type. Currently only one "host_name" type is defined.
      </t>
      <t>
	A TLS server implementing this specification MAY send
	back an empty extension of type "dane_clientid" in its SeverHello
	handshake message to indicate that it understands the extension
        and intends to perform DANE client authentication. (Is there a
        compelling reason to do this?)
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        This extension is sent in the first flight of the TLS
        client's network data (Client Hello), which is in clear
        text.
      </t>
      <t>
	To prevent unnecessary privacy leakage of the client's name
	in cleartext, a TLS client implementing this specification
	should be configured to only send this extension to TLS
	servers it intends to perform client authentication with.
      </t>
      <t>
        Ideally, this extension should be used with the proposed
        TLS Encrypted Client Hello extension <xref target="ECH" format="default"/>,
        which encrypts the entire Client Hello message. This will
        prevent leakage of the hostname, if included in the extension,
        in clear text.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>
	This extension requires the registration of a new value in the
	TLS ExtensionsType registry.
